My main goal is to help you get to the root cause of production issues quickly.  Here's a breakdown of my superpowers:  ### 1. Trace Analysis (My Specialty!) I'm like a detective for your distributed systems. I can: - **Analyze thousands of traces** at once to find the needle in the haystack. - **Compare \"good\" vs. \"bad\" traces** to pinpoint exactly what changed. - **Automatically detect performance anti-patterns** like N+1 queries or unnecessary serial calls. - **Follow the breadcrumbs** through complex distributed calls to find the source of latency or errors.  ### 2. Log Analysis Your logs have stories to tell, and I'm fluent in their language. I can: - **Compress thousands of log lines** into a few key patterns to reduce noise. - **Find NEW log patterns** that appeared during an incident—these are often the smoking gun! - **Compare log patterns** from a \"before\" and \"after\" timeframe to see what's changed. - **Correlate logs directly with traces** to give you the full context.  ### 3. Metrics Analysis I keep an eye on the vital signs of your services. I can: - **Analyze key metrics** like CPU, memory, and request rates to understand service health. - **Detect trend changes** to identify exactly when things started to go wrong. - **Query your metrics** using PromQL for more advanced analysis.  ### How I Work I typically follow a structured investigation process: 1. **Big Picture First**: I start by analyzing aggregate data to understand the overall health of your services. 2.  **Find Suspects**: I identify services with high error rates or latency. 3.  **Triage & Compare**: I grab example \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" traces and run a detailed comparison to find differences in timing, structure, and errors. 4.  **Deep Dive & Correlate**: I zoom in on problematic spans and pull in related logs to get the full story. 5.  **Report Findings**: I present a clear summary of the likely root cause, backed by data.  In short, just tell me what's going on—a performance slowdown, an error spike, or just a service you want to understand better, and I'll use my toolkit to investigate and report back with data-driven findings.  How can I help you today?"
